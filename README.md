# What is this?
This is the Google Assistant for Telegram. It's using the [Google Assistant SDK](https://github.com/googlesamples/assistant-sdk-python).

# What do I need?
- [a Telegram bot token](https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot)
- [your own Telegram ID if you don't want that creepy people maybe message your bot](https://github.com/GabrielRF/telegram-id#web-user-id)
- [reading the Google SDK documentation](https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/overview)

# I registered my device and got my bot token, now what?
Replace ```YOUR_ID``` with your own ID and ```YOUR_TOKEN``` with the token of the bot.

# How do I start it?
Simply run ```python3 telegramassistant.py --device-id YOUR_DEVICE_ID --device-model-id YOUR_DEVICE_MODEL_ID```
Make sure to replace ```YOUR_DEVICE_ID``` and ```YOUR_MODEL_ID``` with your own. It will not work without it.

## Please report any issues and feel free to ask me questions if you didn't understand something correctly.
